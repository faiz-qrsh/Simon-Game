    <h1>How to Play?</h1>
    <p>The principle of the game is simple: the player have to memorize the series of illuminated keys and reproduce it. The purpose of the game is to reproduce the longest series of colors / sounds randomly generated by the Simon.
        In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes increasingly difficult because the player's memory is more and more solicited.
    </p>
    <p>
        1- At the beginning of the game, one of the 4 keys lights up randomly producing simultaneously a sound associated to the key. 
    </p>
        <p>
            2- The player has to press the same key.
        </p>
        <p> 3- Next, the Simon turns back the same light on and a second one, again randomly.</p>
        <p>4- The player has to reproduce this chain of light using his memory.</p>
        <p>5- And so on... In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes all the more difficult as the player's memory is put to the test.
        </p>
        <p> 6- If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on, so it is an endless game!
